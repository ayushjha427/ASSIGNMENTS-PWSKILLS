    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "In Python,exception is an unexpected event that occurs during the excution of program. Exception are a way to handle and respond to issue that can disrupt the normal flow of program. When exception occurs python stops the excution of program and raised an exception object which caught and haldled by the program.\n",
    "exception make code more robust and allow you to deal with errors.\n",
    "some common exception are\n",
    ":- TypeEror,ValueError, I/OError,ZeroDivisionError..or many more\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the Python interpreter cannot understand the code that has been written. Syntax errors are usually caused by spelling mistakes, or incorrect use of Python syntax. Unlike exceptions, which occur during the execution of the program, syntax errors prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur before the program is executed. Exceptions can be handled with try-except blocks, which allow the program to continue running despite the error, while syntax errors must be fixed before the program can be executed."

    "ANSWER:- In Python, you can handle exceptions using the try and except statements. The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors, and the except statement lets you handle those errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:-\n",
    "In this  Examples given below:-\n",
    "We use a try block to enclose the code that may raise exceptions. In this case, we attempt to perform division and take user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the try block, we have multiple except blocks, each handling a specific type of exception. This allows us to provide different error messages or error-handling logic for different exception types. The except blocks are executed in order, and the first one that matches the exception type is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The else block is optional. It contains code that runs if no exceptions were raised within the try block. In this example, it prints \"No exceptions were raised.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By using try and except, you can gracefully handle exceptions and prevent your program from crashing when errors occur, providing a better user experience and making your code more robust."

    "ANSWER:- In Python, custom exceptions are user-defined exceptions that extend the base Exception class. They allow you to create your own exception types with customised error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "we need because of customising the exception and make easily understandable in debugging time due to custom messages or provide more specific and meaningful error messages to the user and make easier to handle errors in a specific way like makking exception handling in structural and organized manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation: Custom exceptions serve as a form of documentation within your code. When other developers encounter your custom exceptions, they can quickly understand the types of errors that may arise and how to handle them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging: Custom exceptions can include additional information or attributes, such as error codes, that aid in debugging and diagnosing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: Using custom exceptions ensures consistency in error handling throughout your codebase. Developers are more likely to handle errors consistently when they are represented by custom exception classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging and Reporting: Custom exceptions can be designed to log error details or report errors to external systems in a consistent manner. This is especially important in applications where monitoring and error tracking are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robustness: Custom exceptions allow you to define error-handling strategies tailored to your application's needs. This can help ensure that your application remains robust even when unexpected issues arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graceful Error Recovery: Custom exceptions enable you to define recovery mechanisms or fallback behaviors for specific error scenarios, enhancing the overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: Custom exceptions make it easier to write unit tests that specifically target error scenarios, improving test coverage and ensuring that error-handling code is thoroughly tested."
